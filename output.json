+ follow artist the best selling white rapper of all time alternately comic and confrontational both hugely talented and highly controversial read full biography overview biography discography songs credits awards related share on facebook twitter tumblr artist biography by stephen thomas erlewine eminem is one of the best selling artists in music history and easily the biggest crossover success ever seen in rap to call him hip hops elvis is fitting to a degree but its largely inaccurate certainly he was the first white rapper since the beastie boys to garner both sales and critical respect but his impact has exceeded this confining distinction on sheer verbal skills eminem is one of the greatest mcs of his generation rapid fluid dexterous and unpredictable capable of pulling off long form narratives or withering asides and thanks to his mentor dr dre hes had music to match thick muscular loops evoking the terror and paranoia conjured by ems lyrics to be certain a great deal of the controversy eminem courted during the turn of the millennium there was no greater pop culture bogeyman than marshall mathers came through in how his violent fantasias often directed at his mother or his wife intertwined with flights of absurdity that appealed to listeners too young to absorb the psychodramas eminem explored on his hit albums the slim shady lp and the marshall mathers lp with hits my name is and the real slim shady he ruled the airwaves but it wasnt long before some detractors acknowledged his depth helped in part by singles like the mournful stan written from the perspective of an obsessed fan eminem capitalized on this forward momentum by crossing over onto the big screen with 8 mile earning acclaim for his performance and an oscar for the films anthem lose yourself a number of demons have led him to withdraw periodically but hes always returned with mid career rejuvenations like 2009s relapse or 2017s revival born marshall mathers in the kansas city missouri suburb of st joseph eminem spent his childhood between missouri and michigan settling in detroit in his teens at the age of 14 he began rapping with a high school friend the two adopting the names manix and mm which soon morphed into eminem under this name mathers entered battle rapping a struggle dramatized in the fictionalized 8 mile initially the predominantly black audience didnt embrace eminem but soon his skills gained him a reputation and he was recruited to join several rap groups the first of these was the new jacks and after they disbanded he joined soul intent who released a single in 1995 this single also featured proof and the two rappers broke off on their own to form d 12 a six member crew that functioned more as a wu tang styled collective than a regularly performing group as he was struggling to establish his career he and his girlfriend kim had a daughter hailey forcing him to spend less time rapping and more time providing for his family he assembled his first album infinite which received some underground attention in 1996 not all of it positive after its release eminem developed his slim shady alter ego a persona that freed him to dig deep into his dark id something he needed as he faced a number of personal upheavals beginning with a bad split with kim which led him to move in with his mother and increase his use of drugs and alcohol capped off by an unsuccessful suicide attempt all this sturm und drang was channeled into the slim shady ep which is where he first demonstrated many of the quirks that became his trademark including his twitchy nasal rhyming and disturbingly violent imagery the slim shady ep opened many doors the most notable of them being a contract with interscope records after eminem came in second at the 1997 rap olympics mc battle in los angeles interscope head jimmy iovine sought him out giving the ep to dr dre who proved eager to work with eminem they quickly cut ems interscope debut in the fall of 1998 during which time marshall reconciled with kim and married her and the slim shady lp appeared early in 1999 preceded by the single my name is both were instant blockbusters and eminem became a lightning rod for attention earning praise and disdain for his violent satirical fantasias eminem quickly followed the slim shady lp with the marshall mathers lp in the summer of 2000 by this point there was little doubt that eminem was one of the biggest stars in pop music the album sold by the truckload selling almost two million copies within the first two weeks of release but mathers felt compelled to tweak other celebrities provoking pop stars in his lyrics and insane clown posses entourage in person providing endless fodder for tabloids this gossip blended with growing criticism about his violent and homophobic lyrics and under this fire he reunited his old crew d 12 releasing an album in 2001 then touring with the group during this furor he had his biggest hit in the form of the moody ballad stan performed at the grammys as a duet with elton john thereby undercutting some accusations of homophobia the song helped eminem to cross over to a middlebrow audience setting the stage for the ultimate crossover of 2001s 8 mile directed by curtis hanson best known as the oscar nominated director of la confidential the gritty drama fictionalized eminems pre fame detroit days and earned considerable praise culminating in one of his biggest hits with the theme lose yourself which won mathers an oscar after all this he retreated from the spotlight to record his third album the eminem show preceded by the single without me the album turned into another huge hit albeit not quite as strong as its predecessor and there were some criticisms suggesting that eminem wasnt expanding his horizons much encore released late in 2004 did reach into more mature territory notably on the anti george w bush mosh but most of the controversy generated by the album was for behind the scenes events a bus crash followed by canceled dates and a stint in rehab rumors of retirement flew and the 2005 appearance of curtain call the hits did nothing to dampen them nor did the turmoil of 2006 a year that saw mathers remarrying and divorcing kim within a matter of four months as well as the shooting death of proof at a detroit club during all this em did some minor studio work but he soon dropped off the radar completely retreating to his detroit home he popped up here and there most notably debuting the hip hop channel shade 45 for sirius satellite radio in september 2008 but it wasnt until early 2009 that he mounted a comeback with relapse an album whose very title alluded to some of mathers struggles with prescription drugs but it also announced that after an extended absence slim shady was back while not quite a blockbuster the album went platinum and eminem followed it at the end of the year with an expanded version of relapse dubbed relapse refill that added outtakes and new recordings recovery initially titled relapse 2 was issued in june 2010 the album debuted on top of the billboard 200 chart where it remained for five consecutive weeks while its leadoff single not afraid debuted on top of the magazines hot 100 singles chart the year 2010 also brought eminem back together with royce da 59 under the bad meets evil moniker in turn june 2011s hell the sequel marked the release of their first ep as a duo and barring the previous months release of key ep track fastlane as a single was their first batch of new material since a 1999 double a side after an intense period of recording eminem announced in august 2013 that his next solo album would be a nostalgically themed set of new material entitled the marshall mathers lp 2 which landed in early november the album featured the singles berzerk rap god and survival plus the chart topping hit the monster with rihanna in 2014 new tracks landed on the double disc set shady xv which celebrated the shady labels 15th birthday the singles phenomenal and kings never die featuring gwen stefani arrived a year later both taken from the southpaw soundtrack eminem resurfaced in october 2017 with a freestyle anti trump rap the track didnt appear on revival the december 2017 album that was filled with cameos including appearances by beyonc walk on water ed sheeran river and p!nk need me his seventh straight chart topper it ultimately failed to match the sales heights of past efforts despite the international success of the river single the next year without warning eminem issued his surprise tenth album kamikaze the set featured appearances by joyner lucas royce da 59 and jessie reyez as well as venom from the film of the same name in january of 2020 he repeated this surprise release approach with 11th studio album music to be murdered by the album featured production from dr dre and cameos from the now usual host of special guests this time featuring q tip ed sheeran anderson paak and the late juice wrld among many others the album debuted at number one on the billboard charts and was re released in expanded form in december under the title music to be murdered by
